JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA. They can offer nifty solutions for complex distributed access control requirements. JWT-based authorization for digital applications works similarly. A JWT is like a travel card. Applications (service providers) are like the different modes of transport. The vending machine that sells travel cards is like the JWT Token Issuer.
